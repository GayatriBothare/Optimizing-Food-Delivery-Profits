The dataset includes detailed information about food orders, such as order values, delivery fees, payment processing fees, discounts, and commission fees.

## Analysis
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
The dataset underwent cleaning and preparation to ensure accurate analysis:

- Standardized 'Discounts and Offers' to numeric values for consistency.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis was conducted to uncover trends and distributions:
- Visualized profitability per order to understand current financial dynamics.
- Compared actual versus recommended (6% discount, 30% commission) rates for profitability.

### Profitability Metrics
Key metrics were calculated to evaluate financial performance:
- Total revenue, costs, and profit.
- Average commission and discount percentages for profitable orders.

## Findings
The analysis revealed insights into the profitability of the food delivery service:
- Current discount strategies often lead to losses, particularly in orders with negative profitability.
